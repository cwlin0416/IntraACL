= IntraACL extension for MediaWiki =

IntraACL extension for MediaWiki is the page rights extension loosely
based on HaloACL, correcting its endless bugs and inconveniences.

* Homepage and help: http://wiki.4intra.net/IntraACL
* License: GNU GPLv3
* Copyright (c) 2010+, Vitaliy Filippov, Stas Fomin
* Loosely based on HaloACL (c) 2009, ontoprise GmbH
* This is IntraACL backed by the '''new''' storage code.
* Version number is 2.2.0-dev.

== REQUIREMENTS ==

* MediaWiki 1.19-1.26 (and also maybe later versions)
* PHP >= 5.3
* MySQL/MariaDB >= 5.1 or PostgreSQL >= 9.0

== INSTALLATION ==

* Add the following lines into your LocalSettings.php:
  require_once('extensions/IntraACL/includes/HACL_Initialize.php');
  enableIntraACL();
* You can also add custom configuration options before enableIntraACL() call. For the option list, see extensions/IntraACL/includes/HACL_Initialize.php or http://wiki.4intra.net/IntraACL
* Apply patches for appropriate version of MediaWiki:
  cd YOUR_WIKI_INSTALLATION_DIR
  patch -p1 < extensions/IntraACL/patches/IntraACL-MediaWiki-<YOUR_VERSION>.diff
* Run MediaWiki database update tool:
  php maintenance/update.php

The method of IntraACL installation via the super-duper-installer
of Halo MediaWiki bundle is now removed as very non-standard.

== WARNING ==

ANY installed extension MAY lead to SECURITY BREACHES.

This is because of MediaWiki by-design openness and extensibility
and the need for direct database queries from extension code.

You should check that all your extensions perform access right checks
using <tt>$title->userCan('read')</tt> before displaying $title content.

When showing page listings from the DB, you can use a stored procedure
for permission checks using the FilterPageQuery hook to modify your query
(for details see FilterPageQuery in includes/Evaluator.php)

== SemanticMediaWiki ==

The original feature of HaloACL (protection of semantic properties
via encrypting them) is also removed. IntraACL is thus incompatible
with the original SemanticMediaWiki.

You may however try the version from Mediawiki4Intranet:
https://github.com/mediawiki4intranet/SemanticMediaWiki - it is slightly outdated
(only 1.8), but it contains a patch which enables read permission checks
in every place that displays information.

If you have experience in PHP you may also try to rebase that patch for newer
SMW versions and send it to us :)

== MediaWiki 4 Intranet ==

You can also use Mediawiki4Intranet bundle. It already includes IntraACL and
many other useful extensions which are patched to perform access right checks.
